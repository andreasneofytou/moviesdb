# Natlicious App

# Create release files

`flutter build appbundle`

# Updating JSON Models

`flutter pub run build_runner build`

# Updating packages 

If youâ€™ve modified your pubspec.yaml file, or you want to update only the packages that your app depends upon (instead of both the packages and Flutter itself), then use one of the flutter pub commands.

To update to the latest compatible versions of all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file, use the upgrade command:

`flutter pub upgrade`

To identify out-of-date package dependencies and get advice on how to update them, use the outdated command. For details, see the Dart pub outdated documentation.

`dart pub outdated --color`
